# gesturecontrolledRV
This is basically a Gesture Controlled Robotic Vehicle project from my junior college days
Several open source libraries are used(Adafruit,MotionApps,NRF24L01,etc.)
Open source code snippets are also used, but I may not always mention the source. Please inform me if your code is present.
