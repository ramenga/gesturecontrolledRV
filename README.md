# gesturecontrolledRV
This is basically a Gesture Controlled Robotic Vehicle project from my junior college days(2014).
I am uploading old codes so the code may not be always clean.
Only basic functionality has been achieved and left at that,so it may not always work in all environments.

Several open source libraries are used(Adafruit,MotionApps,NRF24L01,etc.)

Open source code snippets are also used, but I may not always mention the source. Please inform me if your code is present.
